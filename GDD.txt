## Gameplay Mechanics

### Essence Acquisition
- Essence is the lifeblood of the dungeon, gained from adventurers and creatures.
- Essence quantity is based on the strength and skills of the defeated adventurers.
- Special events or rare adventurers yield bonus essence.

### NPC Adventurers

- Each class has unique abilities and essence values.
- Rare legendary adventurers appear with high risk and reward.

### Dungeon Defenses
- A variety of traps (spike pits, flame jets, etc.) and monsters (slimes, goblins, etc.) can be placed.
- Defenses evolve through multiple stages, becoming more lethal and efficient.
- Players can set patrol routes and behaviors for monsters.

### Dungeon Morphing
- Players can expand the dungeon by creating new rooms and corridors.
- Special rooms, like treasure chambers or cursed crypts, can be constructed to lure adventurers.

### Level Progression
- The dungeon "levels up" by consuming enough essence, unlocking new defense options.
- Higher levels attract stronger adventurers and unlock epic narrative events.

### Environmental Control
- Players can alter the environment to create advantages against adventurers (e.g., flooding rooms, igniting gas leaks).

### Resource Management
- Essence decays if not used, pressuring players to continually expand and evolve.
- Managing the dungeon's reputation is crucial to attracting a steady stream of adventurers.

### Adventurer Lure
- The dungeon can emit a powerful lure, increasing adventurer frequency but also raising the stakes with potential hero invasions.
